# 🖥️ Python Code Editor with Terminal Output
A lightweight, GUI-based code editor built using Tkinter that allows users to write and execute Python code directly within the application. It features a scrollable text editor and an integrated terminal to display output and errors.
 

This project is a simple **code editor and runner** built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to write and execute Python code directly within the interface, displaying the output (or errors) in an embedded terminal-like area.
